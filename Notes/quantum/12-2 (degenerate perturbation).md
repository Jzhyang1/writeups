Degenerate perturbation theory (eigenvalues are degenerate before perturbation)

$$
(H_0+\lambda V)\psi = E\psi
$$

originally, for any $\psi_a$ and $\psi_b$
\[
    H_0\psi_{ab}=E_0\psi_{ab}
\]

With an added perturbation, we may now have some new eigenstate $\psi=\alpha\psi_a+\beta\psi_b$
\[
    (H_0+\lambda V)\psi=E_0(\alpha\psi_a+\beta\psi_b)+(\gamma_a\psi_a+\gamma_b\psi_b)\\
    =\tilde\gamma_a\psi_a+\tilde\gamma_b\psi_b
\]

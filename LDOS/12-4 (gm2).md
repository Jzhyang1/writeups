### When can we consider writing a paper?
* Solve a problem
* Proposing a new problem with an idea of solving it
* Related works: what other things are proposed and how our work is different
* Real world cases, evaluations - end-to-end

### What to have in the paper?
* Theory/insight
* motivation/microbenchmarks/empirical results
* Setting: e.g. in microprocessors it is almost feasible for Belady's


### Things to note
* Write stuff as working/researching
* Conference deadlines/conference styles (e.g. ML vs systems conferences) -> reviewer guidelines are available online
* Stay organized so things can be shared and reproduced
* Hot_XX_ workshops are mostly for sharing ideas
* connected papers
